## Pre-show plan

- Outlining the architecture for a polyglot machine learning project (and what I mean by that)
- Get started on the Python side of things

## Notes

- Multilayer Perceptron: <https://medium.com/biaslyai/pytorch-introduction-to-neural-network-feedforward-neural-network-model-e7231cff47cb>

## Output

- Basic MNIST implementation of a multilayer perceptron that trains to 77% accuracy after 5 epochs (https://github.com/hobofan/polyglot-perceptron) -> Basis for rewrite in Rust is there
